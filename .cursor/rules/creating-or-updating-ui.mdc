For our ui we use:
React
tailwind style utilities
Shadcn components


Please avoid adding anything to [globals.css](mdc:app/globals.css), use tailwind for all styling. 
If you must do something with css that that isn't supported by tailwind (for instance, complex animations), you can add them to global.css. Please do not modify [tailwind.config.ts](mdc:tailwind.config.ts), unless specifically requested.
