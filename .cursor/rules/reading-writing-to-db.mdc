description: This rule is used whenever you would need to write code which reads or writes from the firestore database, backend or frontend, which is the default database we use unless otherwise specified.

# Reading from the db
All reads from the database, whether from the backend or frontend should use the methods in the file [reader.ts](mdc:data/reader.ts). 

# getting data from the db in a react component
If data for a single doc is needed in a react component please use the docObs method from [reader.ts](mdc:data/reader.ts). 
If you need to query multiple docs use the method readQuery from [reader.ts](mdc:data/reader.ts)

In both cases please use the [useObs.tsx](mdc:data/useObs.tsx) helper to mount the RXJs observable that is returned from those two methods.
