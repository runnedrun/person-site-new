# Steps for creating a data model (data type)

All the existing models and their corresponding firestore collection names can be found in [CollectionModels.ts](mdc:data/CollectionModels.ts)

If you need to store data in a collection that isn't listed there, you can create a new model for that data in the folder data/types. The data model is just a Record type wrapped in a Model<> generic type. See [QAPairing.ts](mdc:data/types/QAPairing.ts) for an example. 

Once you've created the model there you can add the name for the collection where the model will be stored in [CollectionModels.ts](mdc:data/CollectionModels.ts), then you can use that collection name with all the methods in [reader.ts](mdc:data/reader.ts) and [writer.ts](mdc:data/writer.ts).
