# Rules for react component creation

If the component is small (less than 10 lines) and will only be used in one file, then it can be created, inline, in that file.
If the component is larger than 10 lines, unless otherwise noted, create a new file for the the new component. 
If the component is used only in one file, you can create it as a sibling file to the file where it's used. Othewise if it's used in more than one place you can create it in components/shared. 
the components/ui path is reserved for shadcn components.
