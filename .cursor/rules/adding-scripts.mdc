Scripts that are run on a one-off basis are added to /scripts.

All these scripts can use any other files in the project, however, at the top of the file they must import dotenv and then use the env file /.env.development. Here is an example script doing that:

import { setDoc } from "@/data/writer"
import dotenv from "dotenv"
import path from "path"

dotenv.config({
  path: path.join(__dirname, "..", , ".env.development"), // this path will be different depending on the scripts location. This path will work if you are in /scripts/fileName.ts
})

const run = () => {
  setDoc("user", "123", {
    testData: true
  })
}

run()
